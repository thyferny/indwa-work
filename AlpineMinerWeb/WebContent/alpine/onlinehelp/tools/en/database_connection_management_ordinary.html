		Non-administrative users can access public database connections and connections available to groups of which they are a member, but cannot directly make changes to the settings. To modify Public or Group connections, the user must duplicate the connection to Personal before making any changes. To do so, select a Public or Group connection and click Duplicate button to Personal. Personal connections can be edited as described in the Administrative section.
