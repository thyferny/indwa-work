                    </li>
                    <li>Selecting an operator will reveal ears if the operator is not terminal. Click and drag an ear to create a connection arrow. Any operator with which
                        the current operator can have a legal connection will remain in color. Each operator with which a valid connection is not currently possible will fade to gray.

                    </li>
                    <li>To complete a connection, pull the arrow over the target operator; a black outline will indicate the target operator will receive the connection. Drop the arrow and the connection will be established.
